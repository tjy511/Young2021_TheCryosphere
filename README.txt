DESCRIPTION
MATLAB scripts to reproduce figures and results from Young et al. (2021). 
for the RESPONDER project including borehole, drill, GPS, meteorological, and lake level datasets amongst others.

- To produce results shown in Figures 3, 4, and 6, run script 'WAIS_polarimetry_master.m'. 
- To produce restuls shown in Figure 5, run script 'WAIS_FujitaModel.m'.
